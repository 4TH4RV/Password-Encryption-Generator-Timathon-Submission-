This is a password encryption generator meaning it encrypts whatever password or input you want to encrypt and makes it really hard for anyone to decrypt if your
input is strong enough.

This has 5 encrption methods:-
* Sha-1
* Sha-256
* Sha-224
* Sha-512
* md5

It also has an option to "hexify" your final password. 

After setting it up just click Generate Button and it will generate a password for you. 

You can copy it to your clipboard. If you want to hide or show the password click on the Eye Close Icon to toggle it.
